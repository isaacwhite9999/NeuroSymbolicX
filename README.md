# NeuroSymbolicX

**NeuroSymbolicX** is an advanced neuro-symbolic AI pipeline for explainable decision-making. It integrates a deep learning model with a symbolic reasoning engine to provide transparent, human-readable explanations of its predictions.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- **Deep Learning:** A robust feed-forward neural network trained on synthetic binary classification data.
- **Symbolic Reasoning:** Advanced, rule-based logic that generates detailed explanations based on input features.
- **Explainable AI:** Seamless integration of neural predictions with symbolic explanations.
- **Advanced Configuration:** Environment-based settings with Pydantic.
- **Robust Engineering:** Comprehensive logging, error handling, asynchronous orchestration, and high test coverage.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git

### Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neurosymbolicx.git
cd neurosymbolicx

Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt


Training the Model

Before using the pipeline for predictions, train the neural network model:
python -c "from app.model import train_model; train_model(epochs=100)"
This will generate synthetic data, train the model, and save it to model.pth.
Using the Pipeline

Run the prediction pipeline from the command line:
python -m app.pipeline --features 0.5 -0.3
Replace 0.5 and -0.3 with your own feature values. The output will display the prediction probability and a symbolic explanation.
Running Tests

Run the unit tests with:
pytest
Docker

You can run NeuroSymbolicX in a Docker container.
Build the Docker Image
docker build -t neurosymbolicx .
Run the Docker Container
docker run -it neurosymbolicx --features 0.5 -0.3
Future Improvements

Integrate more sophisticated neural architectures.
Expand symbolic reasoning rules for richer, data-driven explanations.
Develop a web API or interactive UI for real-time predictions.
Integrate model performance tracking and logging metrics.
